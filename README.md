# 📺 TVLinkQR ➡️📱  

## 🚀 Overview  
Typing web addresses with a TV remote is slow and frustrating.  
**TVLinkQR** solves this by turning your phone into the input method for your TV’s browser.  

Instead of typing directly on the TV, you:  

1. Save a bookmark to the **TVLinkQR** page on your TV browser.  
2. When opened, it shows a **QR code**.  
3. Scan the QR code with your phone → you get a simple input form.  
4. Enter any website on your phone.  
5. Your TV instantly loads that site — no more painful typing with a remote.
